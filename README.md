# Learning-with-disagreements-NLP

The Learning with Disagreement task aims to address the problem of learning
from disagreements in natural language interpretation by providing a standardized testing framework.
Through this project, we hope to build models that successfully predict the ground truth (gold)
target label and models that can effectively capture the disagreement information in the dataset.
